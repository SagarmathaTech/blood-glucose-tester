## **Project: Blood Glucose Tester**

___

### **Overview**

This is only a test project to learn more about the capabilities of machine/deep learning. The idea is to use the camera on a mobile phone to take close-up picture(s) of the finger/palm and a glucose test machine to obtain a blood glucose reading at the time of the picture(s) to test whether there is anything a neural network can see in the skin to make accurate analysis/predictions of someone's blood glucose solely based on close-up pictures of a finger/palm.

The use of other devices with sensors, such as the Apple Watch, will be looked at to determine, first, if the API allows access to these senors, and second, if any image data can be obtained from the sensors. Once that is answered, it would be beneficial to determine if that image data can be used in the model train and then closely estimate glucose levels.

Initially, data will be gathered along side the pictures in order to create a deep learning neural network using supervised learning to train the model. Once enough data and images have been gathered and a model built, it will be tested to determine how accurately the model can estimate blood glucose, if at all.

There has been much work done in the medical field with neural networks and image data to determine if someone has pneumonia, cancer, and other medical conditions. I'm hoping there is something the model can see in the images that would allow for a decent or better estimate of blood glucose in order to allow needle free glucose testing.

Although I am hopeful this will have some significant results, my main purpose is in tying the research being done to a real-world endeavor.
